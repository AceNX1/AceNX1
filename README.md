- Heya, I'm AceNX
(Only AceNX1 because AceNX was taken)
- I'm a SEGA Game collector, a fan of any pi projects, game design, or small scale fun projects. I also make content on youtube (youtube.com/acenx).
- I'm currently knowledgable on the bare basics of javascript and python, and I am able to read basic GDscript.
- I'd love to be a part of any project related to the interests above. 
- I'm most easily reachable through my twitter (AceNX__), so feel free to contact me there.
